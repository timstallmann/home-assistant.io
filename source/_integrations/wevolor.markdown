[Levolor](https://levolor.com) is an American manufacturer of window shades and coverings. Motorized Levolor blinds can be controlled via the [Levolor Premium 6-Channel Remote](https://www.levolor.com/premium-6-channel-remote.html), which syncs via bluetooth with a smartphone app but does not offer any remote control over WiFi.

[Wevolor](https://wevolor.com) is a WiFi enabled IoT device, built by Roger Hoggarth, which syncs with the Levolor 6-channel remote to allow linking Levolor blinds to a home automation system. The Wevolor firmware can be downloaded for free and installed on a compatible Arduino device, or Wevolor devices can be purchased from the Wevolor website.

This integration supports Wevolor [version 5.4](https://wevolor.com/instructions/wevolor_instructions_5_4.html) and greater, using the locally available API. Your Wevolor device will need to have a static IP address on the local network, since Wevolor does not support any sort of auto-discovery.

## Cover

After setup, your shades/blinds will appear in Home Assistant with one entity per channel on the remote, e.g. `cover.wevolor_channel_1`, `cover.wevolor_channel_2`, etc. This integration does not currently support groups of channels. 

For more information on working with shades in Home Assistant, see the [Covers component](/integrations/cover/).

Available services: `cover.open_cover`, `cover.close_cover`, `cover.stop_cover`. When tilt is enabled, `cover.open_cover_tilt`, `cover.close_cover_tilt` and `cover.stop_cover_tilt` are also available.
